## PLEASE, HELP US TEST ANDROJENA! ##

To do so, you just have to download the [Androjena test application package](http://androjena.googlecode.com/files/androjena.test.android.apk) and run it on your device or emulator with the "send results to androjena developers" feature activated. This will really help us speed up the bug-finding process, benchmark support on different devices and improve Androjena. Thanks!

_the Androjena dev team_
